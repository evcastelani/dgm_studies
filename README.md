#DGM Studies

This repository is devoted just for studies in DGM problems.

#Goals

- Implement a simple version of the solution proposed by Coope
to solve intersection of spheres (in Julia Language);
- Implement a simple version of the solution proposed by Coope
to solve intersection of spheres plus least square method (in Julia Language);
- Implement a version of the Coope idea for solving DGM problems in
arbitrary dimension (a branch and prune strategy) (in Julia Language);
- Implement a version of Carlile Branch and prune strategy (in Julia Language);
- Implement a version of AG branch and prune strategy (in Julia Language).
